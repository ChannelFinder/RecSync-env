# SYSTEDM Required and After Service List
# This is After and Required services for the systemd archiver appliance systemd service.
# mariadb.service was defined in there, but sometimes, we need to check our directories where
# our data will be saved.
# one can check the mounting service name through  `systemctl list-units --type=mount`
# Here is the example for the ALS environment
# CONFIG_SITE.local can be used to hold this information locally
# Each service need one space between them, and backslash must be double backslash
