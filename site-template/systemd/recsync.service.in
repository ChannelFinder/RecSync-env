Environment="PYTHONPATH=@RS_INSTALL_LOCATION@"

# Due to User/Group permission, we cannot generate the recsync.log
# in /var/log/ folder. So we put in into the recsync installation
# location instead. In the same way, a PID file also cannot be
# generated. However, we don't need it, since systemd service will
# take care of this.
