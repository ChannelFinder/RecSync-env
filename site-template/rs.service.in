[Service]

#
# Twistd also has the options, but we use the systemd one instead.
#
User=_USERID_
Group=_GROUPID_

# Everything in a local, so we have to tell where PYTHONPATH is
Environment="PYTHONPATH=_PYTHONPATH_"

# Due to User/Group permission, we cannot generate the recsync.log
# in /var/log/ folder. So we put in into the recsync installation
# location instead. In the same way, a PID file also cannot be
# generated. However, we don't need it, since systemd service will
# take care of this.
